# gessq README

This is my first try to write a vscode extension.
I am programming research scripts in the language gess.Q.
Therefore I need a language definition for gess.Q, which is from www.gessgroup.de

## Features

This language includes important snippets, syntax highlighting and symbol definitions within a script.

## Requirements

No external requirements are needed

## Extension Settings

Currently, no settings are supported

## Release Notes

It's still in an alpha version mode. See CHANGELOG.md for detail steps of versioning.

**Enjoy!**
